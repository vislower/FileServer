<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0" alt="License: GPLv3"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg"></a>

## Overview
Actions supported:
* send multiple files and folders to server
* retrieve multiple files and folders from server
* delete multiple files and folders from server
* server can handle multiple client at the same time
* automatic encryption of each file sent to server
* automatic decryption of each file retrieved from server
* encryption is done with AES 256-bit key stored in a KeyStore (the KeyStore is locked with user password)

**The application is for the moment only available in CLI, a GUI version is planned.**

## Requirements :page_facing_up:
* Java version 18 or higher installed on two machines (one will be the client and the other the server), you can check your java version with:
    ```
    java -version
    ```
* You need to know the local IP address of the machine that will act as the server and choose a port on which the server will listen (you will need these information to connect clients to the server).
